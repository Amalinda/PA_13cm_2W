# PA 13cm 2W
Small 2W CW PA for the 13cm hamband. Great as a preamp for Eshail2. Size: 25mm x 25mm<br>
When this PA is used for SSB, a maximum output power of 1W (30dBm) is recommended to ensure linearity.<br>
Maximum measured output power was 34dBm (2.5W), but 36 dBm should be possible as well.

The layout is built and impedance matched for the OSHpark 4-Layer process.
You can order the PCB directly from OSHpark: https://oshpark.com/projects/crZvjwqi

**Make sure to mount the PCB on a suitable heatsink**, as the PA dissipates up to 5W. (M2.5 screws)
Using thermal paste is recommended.
