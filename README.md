# PA_13cm_2W
Small 2W PA for the 13cm hamband. Great as a preamp for Eshail2

The layout is build and impedance matched for the OSHpark 4-Layer process.
You can order the PCB directly from OSHpark: https://oshpark.com/projects/crZvjwqi

Make sure to mount the PCB on a suitable heatsink, as the PA dissapates up to 5W. (M2.5 screws)
Using thermal past is recommended.
